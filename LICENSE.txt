License: 31st March 2020.

  This license applies to the 'DevFsUploadESP' group of library program(s)
  for use on/with Arduino IDE.
  
 Definition
  A "library" is comprised of a set of files, as listed below, which 
  are grouped together to be an executable library-program. 
     (C/C++ files .h and .cpp pairs are implied [.h/.cpp])
   
     - DevFsUpload.h/.cpp
     -                    DevFsUploadCommon.h/.cpp
                                   |
                  +----------------.---------------+
                  |                                |
         DevFsUploadSPIFFS.h/.cpp         DevFsUploadLittleFS.h/.cpp
         
                         [one or the other]
     
   "personal use" is a person using the library(ies) for there own 
   development.
   
   "entity use" is using for development purposes within a collaborative
   project, comprising persons or teams within an organization.

  Documentation is provided with the program in its Github repository 
  and is also covered by this license.
  
 Conditions
  1. Use is royality free for development activities (testing, 
     design,....) both commerical and non-commerical.

  2. Modification may be made with the provision:
     a) That a different class name is used. That is; not 
        'DevFsUploadSPIFFS' or 'DevFsUploadLittleFS' or 'DevFsUploadCommon' 
        or 'DevFsUploadESP'.
     b) An attribute to original library-author(s) is provided in the 
        new code/class.
     c) An "origin" statement/pointer to original library source is 
        provided in the new code/class.
     d) Sub-licensing to a more open/permissive/closed license is 
        not permitted.

  3. The library is provided AS-IS and has no warranty as to fitness 
     for use. Determining fitness for use is the responsibility of 
     the user.

  4. This library may not be productized, that is provided 
     with/along/packaged-with a consumer product, either commerical or 
     non-commerical.

  5. The user accepts the limitations below as necessary for the 
     program to be functional and none interferring with a users
     product/project development.

  6. The "library" is not open-source.

  7. Modification allows other persons/entities to re-use the 
     intelluctual property for 'personal use' or for 'entity
     use', but not change these license conditions.

  Limitations:
  As a program/library there are working limits on an embedded MCU
  device that the "library" does not cater for. Unknown/unpredictable
  failures will occur if the user pushes the MCU device beyond its
  capabilities using the "library".

  The program is meant as a development tool/aid, not a product, and as
  such has limited fault tolerence code.

  The program interacts with other sub-systems that it has no control
  over: HTML, Javascript, Javascript access to client PC file
  structures,......... which restrict capability.
  
  License-end
  
 Why this license. 
  All the GNU, GPL, MIT,.... typical licenses allow modifications where
  same-name may be used and deployed, causing confusion for users and
  causes trust issues. Additionally, 
  - typical license(s) allow productization, this library would not 
    be suitable as a product.
